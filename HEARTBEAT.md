# HEARTBEAT.md - Periodic Checklist

This file is checked every 30 minutes. Add tasks here for continuous work.

## Current Tasks

### 🍳 Recipe Development (Auto-continue)
If `memory/RECIPES_TODO.md` exists, continue working on recipes:
1. Read TODO list
2. Pick next recipe to create
3. Write recipe file
4. Update index
5. Remove from TODO

### 🔧 General Maintenance
- Check for any pending approvals
- Report progress on long-running tasks

## To Start Overnight Work

Create a file with task description, e.g.:
```
memory/RECIPES_TODO.md - List of recipes to create
memory/CODE_TODO.md - Code tasks to complete
```

I will auto-detect and continue working on these.
