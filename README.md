# EnPlace

EnPlace is a calm, mobile‑first cooking companion.

It is designed to feel like a personal sous‑chef — focused, non‑commercial, and present during the act of cooking itself, not just recipe discovery.

## What EnPlace Is
- A mobile‑first app (React Native)
- Focused on cooking flow, not feeds
- Quiet by default, intentional by design
- Built for real kitchens, real timing, real mess

## What EnPlace Is Not
- Not a recipe marketplace
- Not a content platform
- Not optimized for scrolling or engagement metrics
- Not trying to replace cookbooks — just help you cook

## Status
This project is in **early planning and foundation phase**.
Decisions are being documented before implementation.

## Repository Structure (early)
- `docs/` — vision, principles, and decisions
- `app/` — the mobile application (to be created)
- `.github/` — workflows and project hygiene (later)

## Philosophy
We prefer:
- clarity over speed
- small scope over big promises
- tools that get out of the way

If it feels calm, we’re doing it right.
