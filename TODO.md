# enPlace TODO List

## Project Board
🔗 **Kanban Board**: https://github.com/users/CryptoPapi7/projects/1

### Setup Instructions (Manual)
1. Go to the board URL above
2. Set up columns: **Backlog** | **Todo** | **In Progress** | **Done**
3. Add these items:

### Backlog
- [ ] Pre-cook process overview — show all steps/timeline before cooking starts
  - User feedback: "likes to see all the steps ahead of cooking to get a sense for the process"
  - Could be: preview mode, timeline view, or summary screen before cook mode
  - Consider: total time per section, active vs passive time breakdown

- [ ] Build standalone iOS preview (via EAS or TestFlight)
  - Currently requires laptop + Expo Go + same WiFi
  - Options: `expo start --tunnel`, or EAS build with Apple Developer account ($99/year)

### Done
- [x] Fix StepView.tsx 'styles' property error (added StyleSheet.create)
