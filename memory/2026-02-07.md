## Session Summary

**Key accomplishment:** Set up remote development workflow for EnPlace app.

### What Got Done

1. **Expo Dev Server Setup**
   - Installed dependencies in `/home/azureuser/.openclaw/workspace/app/`
   - Started expo dev server with tunnel mode (`npx expo start --tunnel --port 8081`)
   - Set up ngrok for external access
   - Created QR code server on port 8082 for easy phone connection

2. **Live Reload Testing**
   - User successfully connected via iPhone on different WiFi network
   - Verified live reload works instantly on code changes
   - Made test changes: added subtitle "one dish, perfectly" to home screen

3. **Documentation**
   - Updated `TOOLS.md` with remote dev workflow details
   - Updated `MEMORY.md` with project configuration
   - Set git identity for commits

### Technical Details

- **Tunnel URL:** `https://knyrmhy-anonymous-8081.exp.direct` (rotates on restart)
- **QR Code URL:** `http://40.117.250.147:8082/qr.png`
- **Architecture:** Azure VM → Expo Dev Server → Ngrok Tunnel → iPhone

### Session Notes

- Main session has deliveryContext pointing to telegram, causing sync quirks with webchat
- Subagent sessions now visible in webchat session switcher
- Channel bridging (telegram ↔ webchat bidirectional) is NOT a built-in feature — would need custom solution

### Next Steps (Pending)

- Build EnPlace features:
  - Recipe data structure
  - Recipe screen
  - Step-by-step cook mode UI

### Working Environment

- Model: kimi (switched from GPT)
- Gateway restarted once earlier (session continuity maintained)
- Full remote dev flow operational
