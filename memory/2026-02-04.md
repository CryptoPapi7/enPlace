Frontend preferences discovered via constraints: User prefers fewer taps over strict platform purity (1=A); dislikes unexpected motion (2=A); prefers app to stay out of the way vs guiding (3=B); requires obvious-first-use over learning curve (4=B). Implication: calm, low-motion, utility-leaning UI with clear affordances and minimal interaction cost.
