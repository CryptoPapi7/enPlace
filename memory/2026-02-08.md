## Completed Today

### EnPlace App
- [x] Added stirring animation to CookScreen
- [x] Animation triggers on steps: curry-2, curry-4, curry-5
- [x] Extracted professional "Stirring into the sunset" animation from LottieFiles
- [x] Embedded all 18 images as base64 in JSON (self-contained)
- [x] Fixed Metro bundler cache issues
- [x] App working with correct animation!

### Infrastructure
- [x] Set up Expo as systemd service (auto-starts on boot)
- [x] Set up cloudflared tunnel service
- [x] Created QR code server on port 8082 for easy access

### Tailscale Setup (Major Achievement!)
- [x] Installed Tailscale on VM
- [x] VM connected with Tailscale IP: 100.102.100.72
- [x] Windows desktop also in tailnet: 100.89.156.81
- [x] Expo Go now works with direct exp:// URL via Tailscale

### Still Pending
- [ ] Mobile approvals web UI - gateway only binds to localhost (127.0.0.1:18789)
- [ ] Need to change gateway.bind from "loopback" to "tailnet"
- [ ] Valid bind values discovered: "loopback", "lan", "tailnet", "auto", "custom"

### Lessons Learned
- [ ] Expo --lan mode binds to network interface, NOT localhost
- [ ] Cloudflared needs localhost binding to work properly
- [ ] Tailscale solves both Expo Go access AND potential mobile approvals
- [ ] Critical config backup protocol added to SOUL.md and TOOLS.md
- [ ] Always research valid config values before editing openclaw.json

## Key URLs
- Expo via Tailscale: exp://100.102.100.72:8081
- QR Code: http://40.117.250.147:8082/qr.png
- Backup location: ~/.openclaw/backups/
