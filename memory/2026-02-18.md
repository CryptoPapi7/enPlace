## enPlace Image Architecture & Recipe Cleanup (Checkpoint)

**Goal locked:** AVIF-only image architecture with emoji fallback; Supabase public storage URLs.

**Decisions (durable):**
- AVIF is the sole image format for v1 (no JPG fallback); emoji fallback if AVIF unsupported.
- Image spec: 4:3 aspect ratio, 1600x1200 target, Michelin-bistro style.
- Storage: Supabase Storage public URLs (no signed URLs).
- Home cards standardized: 300px width, 4:3 images, 12px margin, snapToInterval 312.
- Title overlay height reduced to 50px with ~0.35 opacity.
- RecipeScreen hero shows clean image (no text overlay); title/description below.

**Completed:**
- Home screen horizontal image cards (Netflix-style sections).
- RecipeScreen hero redesign.
- Added AVIF images to 12 recipes (ramen, rendang, birria tacos, cacio e pepe, chicken curry w/ paratha roti, pasta pomodoro, sourdough, pepperpot, dhal puri roti, Caribbean fish curry, doubles, pho bo).
- Deleted wrong/duplicate recipes: roti-curry-channa, fresh-pasta.
- Fixed birria-tacos syntax issue.

**In Progress / Blocker:**
- Remove Street Tacos placeholder from `app/data/recipes/index.ts` (`ALL_RECIPES`, id: 'tacos', available: false). Edit tool rejected empty-string deletion; plan to rewrite file or use alternative edit.

**Next:**
- Verify all recipes expose `imageUrl` in `ALL_RECIPES`.
- Test image loading across Home, Library, Recipe screens.
- Resume cook mode improvements when ready.
